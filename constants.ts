    science: '1971 analysis confirmed it is human myocardial (heart) tissue, type AB blood (same as Shroud of Turin), with no preservatives.',
    fullStory: `In the Church of St. Legontian, a doubting Basilian monk witnessed the Host become flesh and the wine coagulate into five blood globules during Mass. Preserved for over 1,250 years, 1970–1971 and 1981 analyses by Professor Odoardo Linoli confirmed the flesh as human myocardial (heart) tissue with arterioles, veins, and nerves, and the blood as type AB—both from a living person, without preservatives. The globules' weight equals any single one or all combined, defying physics. Approved by the Church in the 17th century and reaffirmed, this earliest documented miracle in Europe set a precedent for scientific scrutiny, inspiring faith amid early medieval doubts on the Real Presence.`
